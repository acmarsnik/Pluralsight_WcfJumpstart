Implementing Clients
Introduction

Hi, this is Brian Noyes. This module is going to focus on implementing the client-side of the WCF equation. So we're going to look at how you get connected to the service that we've implemented so far, focusing primarily on code generating the client-side proxy code needed, but also talking a little bit about manually coding it. First up we'll talk about what you need on the client-side in a general sense, and we'll talk through how you code generate things, what the code generation does for you, and other considerations on the client-side. Then we'll get into demo mode and we'll start off by talking through code generating the proxy code you need on the client-side with the add service reference feature of Visual Studio. Then we'll look at actually making calls from the client through that proxy, and talk about what that code needs to look like, and some of the considerations. Finally, we'll finish up by talking about manually implementing your client proxies instead of code generating them so that you can see what that looks like, and we'll talk about when you might do that. So let's dive right in on the client-side.
