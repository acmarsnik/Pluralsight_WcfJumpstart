Summary

So in this module we covered the client-side of things, being able to consume WCF services from. NET clients. You saw that add service reference makes it a snap to create the client-side proxy code that you need to start consuming a WCF service. You saw that the generated proxies have both synchronous and asynchronous methods by default, and those asynchronous methods by default are based on the task-based asynchronous pattern, allowing you to use the async and await keywords that make our lives a lot easier with asynchronous code in. NET these days. You saw that the minimal client configuration code is generated as part of the code gen process as well, but you may need to tweak some of that to add things like max message sizes and time outs and things like that that are appropriate for the client requirements. And finally you saw that you can easily manually implement your proxies. It doesn't take a lot of code and it gives you more control over that code in case you want to encapsulate more advanced patterns into the proxy class.
