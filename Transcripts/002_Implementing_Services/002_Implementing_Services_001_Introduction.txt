Implementing Services
Introduction

In this module we're going to start diving into implementing our pizza ordering system, starting with the service definition, which includes defining service contracts, data contracts, and the service implementation class. First up we'll summarize the overall process of defining a service implementation. And then we'll get right down to code and start off by defining service contracts, let you see what it looks like at code, and discuss the considerations there. Part of defining a service contract, as discussed in module one, is defining data contracts, the parameters that flow into methods, and the return types that come back from them. So we'll look at what it means to define a data contract, and what some of the options are there. Finally, we'll get to the service implementation class where the gory details of your logic sit that's being invoked over the service boundary, and we'll see what some of the options are there. And that will complete this module before we move on to hosting the service in the next module. So let's dive right in.
