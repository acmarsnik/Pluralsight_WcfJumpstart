Quick Intro to WCF Security
Introduction

Hi, this is Brian Noyes. In this last module I want to give you a Quick Intro to WCF Security. So far in the course we've seen how to define services, get them hosted, and consume them from clients. But no one should approach building WCF services and deploying them without securing them. Now security's a big topic in WCF, so I'm only going to scratch the surface in this module and give you a sense of what the capabilities are and demonstrate one of the most common usage, especially in enterprise scenarios, which is to use the built-in Windows security. First off we'll give a high level overview of what the security capabilities of WCF are. Then we'll go into some specifics on Windows authentication, which is the default, and again is a very common form of security to use because it's the default and because it covers a broad range of scenarios for enterprise applications. We'll look at what's on by default and how you can leverage that, and we'll also look at the end about how to use alternate credentials from the client-side. So let's dive into a quick tour of security.
