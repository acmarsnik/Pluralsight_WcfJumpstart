WCF Security Overview

So as I've mentioned several times, in general, service calls should be secured. There might be some specialized scenarios on a closed network where you have physical security mechanisms preventing anyone bad from getting access to your network, but in more common scenarios, even enterprise scenarios, you should assume that bad things can happen on your network and someone might try to compromise your service calls. So you need to authenticate the caller and make sure you know who they are, and that you believe they are who they say they are, that's basically what authentication's about. Next you need to authorize based on the authentication and the identity that you've established for that caller, then you can make decisions about what they have access to on the server-side, whether that means what specific operations on a given service they have access to, or more fine-grained things like doing data filtering based on that identity. The good news here is most WCF bindings are secure by default, and they are secure based on Windows authentication and authorization. The one stand out that we've been using in some of our demos is the BasicHttpBinding. That binding is not secure by default, it sends no credentials, it just is kind of wide open. There are ways to lock it down and use HTTP-based security with it, things like basic authentication or Windows authentication, but by default it's wide open. If you need an HTTP binding that's secure by default, you should look at using the WSHttpBinding.
