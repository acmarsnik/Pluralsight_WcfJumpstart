Course Complete

So that brings us to the end of this WCF Jumpstart course. I hope you got a lot out of it. We covered a lot of ground starting you from defining service contracts, data contracts, and implementing services, to hosting those services in a self host, or IIS hosted in a web application project, implementing clients by code generating their proxies or hand coding them, and then working with security, particularly the built-in security using Windows authentication. There are a lot of other courses in the Pluralsight library on WCF to take you to the next level. There are end to end courses and specialty courses on particular topics, and I definitely recommend you go check out that category for more courses to take you to the next level. Thanks again for watching.
