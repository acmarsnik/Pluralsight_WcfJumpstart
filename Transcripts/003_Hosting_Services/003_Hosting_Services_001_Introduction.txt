Hosting Services
Introduction

Hi this is Brian Noyes, in this module we're going to cover hosting your services, giving them a Runtime environment to exist in to answer calls. First up, we'll talk about hosting in general, and what your options are there, then we'll dig right in in demo mode. And first off we'll talk through the service configuration that you'll need, which unfortunately is the most complex area of WCF, and it's one of the things that sometimes gives WCF a bad reputation because you do need a fair amount of configuration to set up your services. Once we've talked through the configuration, we'll look at running your service in the WCF Service Library you defined it in. Then we'll move on to self hosting, which is running it in any. NET process, and we'll see how to do it in a console app in the demos, but for production and deployment purposes, this would often be in a Windows service deployed to a server. And then finally, we'll look at IIS hosting, if you're just going to be exposing web protocols, then IIS makes a great host for this, and give you a lot of configurability options. So we'll see how you create a web project that can be deployed to IIS as your host. So let's dive right in.
