Summary

So in this module you learned the basics of WCF in concept, and got a quick introduction to getting started building out WCF services and demos. You learned that WCF is really all about making it as easy as possible to connect clients and services for remote communications using. NET. You saw that one of the important concepts to wrap your head around is that the service boundary that's exposed to a client is defined through a combination of the Service Contract itself, the Data Contracts that are part of the operations on that Service Contract, and the configuration that defines things like the protocols being used and the security. You learned that to expose the service you have to define endpoints, and endpoints are defined based on an Address, Binding, and Contract, the ABCs of WCF. You saw that another important configuration aspect is the behaviors. Behaviors configure aspects of how the service behaves when messages are received. And you learned that Bindings configure the aspects of the communication pipe between the client and the service. So now we're ready to dive in and start building out a more realistic service end to end, and we'll define the service itself in the next module, then we'll define the service hosting environment in the following module, then we'll define the client that consumes it, and finally we'll wrap up by talking about security.
