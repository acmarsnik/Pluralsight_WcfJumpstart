WCF Configuration

Now when it comes to that WCF configuration, there are some basic sections that you'll find in there that we'll see once we get into the demos. The first, and most important, are the endpoint definitions. Endpoints are composed of what are called the ABCs of WCF. A stands for Address, B for Binding, and C for Contract. The address is how does a client get to that service? The binding wraps up all the gory details of how the communication works at a wire-level. And the contract defines what's exposed at the service for the client to call into. To wrap your head around this I like to make the analogy to making a phone call, to have a successful phone call you need three pieces of information. You need a number to dial, that's the equivalent of the address; you need a subject to talk about, that's the equivalent of the contract; and then you have to be speaking the same language as the person you're calling to successfully communicate. And all those aspects of speaking the same language at a wire-level are wrapped up in the binding. Another important section in your configuration are behaviors. Behaviors are basically aspects of how the service handles a call once it comes into the service. So it's implementation details that are isolated to one side, or the other, but are plumbing details, not really your business functionality. Lastly, there are binding configurations. You can see binding is part of the endpoint, but every binding has lots of optional, configurable aspects to it. Things like how big can your messages be, or what kind of security are you using, or are you allowing distributed transactions to flow? These are all things that get wrapped up in the binding definition, but can be turned on and off with configuration options for a given binding. And those things reside in this section. So now that we've covered the key concepts and building blocks of WCF, let's dive right in to some demos to get you familiar with what it looks like to start working with WCF.
