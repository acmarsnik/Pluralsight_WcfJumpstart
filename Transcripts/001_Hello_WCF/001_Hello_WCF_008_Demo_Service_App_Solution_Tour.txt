Demo: Service App Solution Tour

In this demo I want to give you a quick walkthrough of what we're going to be building up over the rest of the modules in the course. We're going to be putting together a simple little app that has client- and service-side to it that's using WCF for communication and the domain of the application is a pizza ordering system. So think of a guy in a pizza shop that gets a phone call and needs to put in an order for a customer, and a simple application to help him with that, possibly across a distributed chain, that needs services to get to a backend that's shared across more than one store. The solution architecture here is that we have the service definitions in a WCF class library, similar to what we saw in the last demo. We have some different hosting environments available to us with SelfHost and IISHost that we'll talk about in a later module. The data that we're working with that's going across the wire, are our entity definitions that can be shared between the client and server, so they're factored out into their own class library. The data access used by the services is factored out to its own class library. And then we have a simple WPF client that will be making the service calls. We have the solution configured to run more than one project at once, it's actually going to run the SelfHost console app as a hosting environment and run the WPF client. So if I go and click the Start debugging button, we can see our console host starting up, then our WPF client, and it's already made a call to the server to get back this product information that's being listed here. Next to each listed item is an Add To Order button, we can click on those and you can see over on the left items being added. We can pick a customer, the list for which was also pulled back from a WCF service call for that order. And then down at the bottom we can click the Submit Order button, and send that order off to the server-side for persistence and processing. So crude, simple UI here, didn't make any attempts to make it pretty and complicate the client application. And we're not really going to focus on the UI presentation aspects, anyway. So that's the end to end application we're going to build up through the subsequent modules, and talk through all the bits and pieces you really need to know to get up and running with WCF quickly.
