Hello WCF!
Course Intro

Hi, this is Brian Noyes and welcome to this course, WCF Jumpstart. This course is designed to take you from ground zero to up and running with WCF in a very short amount of time. This course makes no assumptions about any background in WCF, although hopefully you have the general idea of what WCF, or Windows Communication Foundation, is for. It's for connecting clients and services across distributed boundaries, local area networks, or across the internet. So in this course you'll learn how to define services, the hosting environment for those services, and clients to connect to those services to get you started using WCF quickly. Let's talk about what we're going to cover in this course. This first module that we're in right now is the Hello WCF module, and we'll cover the fundamental concepts behind WCF, and walk you through some quick demos to get you familiar with the experience of working with WCF. Then starting with the second module, I'm going to start walking you through the process of defining services, defining the host for those services, implementing clients to connect to those services, and finally, a quick intro to security because you shouldn't build real world services and deploy them without having some security around them. So through these modules I'll walk you through the process of connecting end to end with WCF to get you up and running. Now let's talk about what we're going to cover in this first module.
